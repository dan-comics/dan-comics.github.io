# How to Add New Comics or Series

Your website now uses a **manifest system** to avoid GitHub API rate limits!

## 📚 Adding a New Comic to an Existing Series

1. Navigate to the series folder in `Website/[Series Name]/`
2. Add your comic image files (.jpeg, .jpg, .png, .gif, .heic, or .pdf)
3. **Run the build script** to update the manifest:
   ```bash
   python3 build-manifest.py
   ```
4. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new comics to [Series Name]"
   git push
   ```
5. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages to rebuild
6. Refresh your website - the new comics will appear! ✨

## 🆕 Adding a New Series (Folder)

1. Create a new folder in `Website/` with your series name
2. Add comic images to that folder
3. **Run the build script** to update the manifest:
   ```bash
   python3 build-manifest.py
   ```
4. Commit and push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new series: [Series Name]"
   git push
   ```
5. The new series will appear with a default 📚 icon and random color

### Optional: Customize New Series Icon & Color

To give your new series a custom icon and color:

1. Open `index.html` in a text editor
2. Find the `seriesConfig` section (around line 635)
3. Add your series like this:
   ```javascript
   'Your Series Name': { icon: '🎨', color: '#FF5733' }
   ```
4. Run the build script and commit

**Example:**
```javascript
const seriesConfig = {
    'Origional Dan': { icon: '⭐', color: '#FF6B6B' },
    'Dan Funnies': { icon: '😂', color: '#4ECDC4' },
    'My New Series': { icon: '🚀', color: '#42A5F5' }  // ← Add your new series here
};
```

## 📝 Supported File Types

- `.jpeg` / `.jpg`
- `.png`
- `.gif`
- `.heic`
- `.pdf`

## ⚙️ How It Works

The website uses a **manifest.json** file generated by `build-manifest.py`:
- The script scans all folders in `Website/` directory
- Finds all image/PDF files in each folder and subfolder
- Generates `manifest.json` with the complete comic library
- The website loads from the manifest (no API calls = no rate limits!)

## 🔧 Build Script Details

The `build-manifest.py` script:
- Automatically discovers all series folders
- Finds all comics in each folder
- Handles nested subfolders (like FLL - Band of Bots)
- Excludes Background.JPG and .DS_Store files
- Shows a summary of comics found

**Always run the build script after adding new comics!**

## 🎯 Quick Workflow

Every time you add comics:
```bash
# 1. Add your comic files to the appropriate folder
# 2. Run the build script
python3 build-manifest.py

# 3. Commit everything
git add .
git commit -m "Add new comics"
git push
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

**Comics not showing up?**
1. Did you run `python3 build-manifest.py`?
2. Check that `manifest.json` was updated
3. Did you commit and push `manifest.json`?
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for GitHub Pages
5. Clear your browser cache and refresh

**Build script errors?**
1. Make sure Python 3 is installed: `python3 --version`
2. Check that you're in the project directory
3. Ensure the `Website/` folder exists

**New series not appearing?**
1. Make sure the folder is inside `Website/`
2. Add at least one image file to the folder
3. Run the build script
4. Check that manifest.json includes the new series
